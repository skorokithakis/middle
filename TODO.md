# TODO items

Work on these one at a time. Mark them as done when done:

[x] Try to find ways to increase BT download speed.
[ ] See why the pendant never seems to sleep. Review every code path and make sure they all lead to sleep at the end.
[ ] Remove all serial debugging code to save on latency/battery.
[ ] Implement some sort of security or encryption on both ends, probably with a preshared key.

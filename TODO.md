# TODO items

Work on these one at a time. Mark them as done when the user confirms they're done:

[ ] Implement some sort of security or encryption on both ends, probably with a preshared key.
[ ] Recordings aren't transferred in order of recording, and they should. We should increment the filenames to make sure the recordings are in order.
